# Automatic Street Light

## Overview
This project automatically turns ON a street light (LED) when it gets dark and turns it OFF when it is bright using an LDR sensor.  

## Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- Resistor (10kΩ)
- LED
- Breadboard + Jumper wires

## Features
- Energy saving – lights only ON in darkness.  
- Fully automatic, no manual switching.  
- Simple circuit, easy to implement.  

## Circuit Diagram

## How to Run
1. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.  
2. Upload `street_light.ino` to Arduino using Arduino IDE.  
3. Cover/uncover LDR to test LED operation.  

## Future Improvements
- Use relay to control high-power AC street lights.  
- Add motion sensor for smart lighting.
